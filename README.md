# AWS IAM POLICY LINTER
This is an AWS IAM policy (JSON) linter written in Go to identify and lint overly persmissive IAM policies. Often provisioning resources through Infrastrucure as Code with Terraform, I needed a tool to perform sanity checks on JSON-formatted IAM policies before provisioning. This CLI tool builds on my experience using Go applications in dev containers for full CI/CD pipeline workflows.
